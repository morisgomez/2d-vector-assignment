# 2d-vector-assignment
Practice creating matrix via 2 dimensional vectors.
<br/>
<br/>
Write a program that reads in 16 values from the keyboard and tests whether they form a
magic square when put into a 4 × 4 vector. You need to test three features:
<br/>
<br/>
• (25 pt) Does each of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 16 occur once (and only once) in the user
input?
<br/>
<br/>
• (25 pt) Can you process the input into the form of 2 dimensional vector form?
<br/>
<br/>
• (30 pt) When the numbers are put into a square, are the sums of the rows, columns,
and diagonals equal to each other?
